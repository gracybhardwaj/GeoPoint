Our Project: Low-cost & Low-power Waterproof GEOPOINT

This project leverages sensors and satellite/cellular connectivity to gather environmental data on farms in remote areas, which is processed using AI to optimize irrigation schedules, predict trends like drought or disease outbreaks, and provide real-time insights through a full-stack web application.

Challenges/Problems: 
Sustainable agriculture aims to maintain soil conditions, while regenerative agriculture goes further by improving soil quality, rebuilding natural systems, and helping to reverse climate change. 

Its focus on increasing soil biodiversity enhances resilience to environmental stresses like drought and heavy rains, making soils and crops more adaptable. 
Practices like no-till cultivation, cover crops, and crop rotation sequester carbon in the soil, promoting healthier plants and often reducing input costs.

KEY IDEA: measure carbon levels

ADDITIONAL IDEA: Send alerts on when crops should be covered/crop rotation
Crop Irrigation is expensive, especially with climate change exacerbating water scarcity issues, especially for farmers in remote areas

ADDITIONAL IDEA: Measure soil moisture
Most organisms thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6-7).
Look for indirect indicators

What is it?

Utilizing sensors and satellite/cellular connection, we can have many Geopoints located in a grid on remote farms to send data to remote servers for processing.

These data can include:

Water levels

Humidity

Temperature

Plant Health

UV Detection

The data will then be processed remotely using AI to predict and output onto an authenticated full-stack application for end-users to access.

Predict trends such as drought, optimal irrigation times, or even disease outbreaks in crops based on environmental conditions
Make predictions about future conditions (e.g., when plants will need water based on previous humidity and temperature readings) to help optimize irrigation schedules.
